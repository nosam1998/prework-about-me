        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I've been programming since age eight. I'm in the process of taking the University of Oregon Full Stack
            Bootcamp.</p>
        <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
        <p>I'm from a small town in Oregon</p>
        <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
        <p>I love puzzles! I learned to solve the Rubik's Cube at age nine. I remember passing the cube back and forth
            between someone a met on an airplane on the way home from Disney World. They would mix it up and pass it
            back to me and I would solve it, and the process would repeat for a couple of hours. I also love debugging
            code!</p>
        <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
        <p>I'm more of a behind the scenes kind of guy. So I'd have to say I'd like to be a backend web developer or a
            Software Engineer.</p>
        <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
        <p>I live in a house with some roommates.</p>
        <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
        <p>To be honest... I don't have a particular reason. I just love programming and solving puzzles in general!</p>
